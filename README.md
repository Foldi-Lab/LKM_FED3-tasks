# LKM_FED3-tasks
Arduino files for operant learning tasks used in Conn, Milton et al for FED3 devices

This repository contains the task files created to perform assessment of operant learning paradigms in Conn, Milton et al submitted for publication in December 2023.
These are original resources from Lex Kravitz and his team for use with the FED3 device https://github.com/KravitzLabDevices/FED3 that have been modified by Laura K Milton.
The code is written in the Arduino language and is run on a Feather M0 Adalogger microcontroller inside of FED3. For information from the FED3 users community check out the Google group (https://groups.google.com/g/fedforum).
